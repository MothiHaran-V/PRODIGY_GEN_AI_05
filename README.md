🌐 Task 5 – Network Packet Sniffer

Internship: Cybersecurity – Prodigy Infotech


---

📄 Description

This task involves building a network packet sniffer using Python. The program captures live packets from the network interface and displays details such as:

Source and Destination IP addresses

Protocol used (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)

Packet size and content (basic payload data)


The tool helps users understand how data travels over a network, which is essential in cybersecurity for monitoring, troubleshooting, and detecting suspicious activities.
